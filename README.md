# FakeFeed

FakeFeed is a Kirigami based application that replaces the original camera feed with a virtual video devices. Normal (v4l2) applications will read these devices as if they were ordinary video devices, but the video will not be read from e.g. a capture card but instead it is generated by this application.


# Requirements

- kirigami2 
- kde-sdk-meta 
- gettext
- FFmpeg
- [v4l2loopback-dkms](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/archive/refs/tags/v0.12.5.tar.gz)

This list might be rendered incomplete in future due to development. There kindly look at CMake files and build logs for in-situ detail. 

# Build

`$ git clone https://github.com/deprov447/fakefeed.git`
`$ mkdir build && cd build`
`$ cmake ..`
`$ make -j$(nproc)`
`$ sudo bin/FakeFeed`

This assumes all dependencies are installed. Kindly build the dependencies yourself if your distribution does not provide them/have outdated versions.
